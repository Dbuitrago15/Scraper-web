## 2025-09-27 - API Server & Job Queue Implementation

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ **Fastify Server Setup**: Implemented complete API server with multipart file upload support
  - Added `@fastify/multipart` plugin for file handling
  - Created health check endpoint: `GET /health`
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ **CSV Upload Endpoint**: Created `POST /api/v1/scraping-batch` endpoint
  - Accepts multipart/form-data with CSV file
  - Validates file type and presence
  - Streams and parses CSV using `csv-parser`
  - Returns unique `batchId` and job count
- ✅ **BullMQ Integration**: Implemented job queue system
  - Created `scrapingQueue` with Redis connection
  - Added job retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Implemented comprehensive queue event logging
  - Created `addScrapingJob` function for job creation
- ✅ **Configuration Management**: Enhanced config system
  - Added environment variable loading with dotenv
  - Configured Redis connection parameters
  - Set up comprehensive application settings
- ✅ **Application Bootstrap**: Updated main entry point
  - Integrated server startup with configuration
  - Added graceful shutdown handling
  - Implemented proper error handling and logging

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Job Creation Flow**: CSV rows → Stream parsing → Individual job creation → Queue insertion
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at all levels with proper HTTP status codes
- **Performance**: Streaming CSV parser for memory efficiency with large files
- **Monitoring**: Queue event logging for job lifecycle tracking
- **Security**: File type validation and input sanitization

### Dependencies Added
- `@fastify/multipart`: For handling file uploads in Fastify

### API Endpoints Implemented
- `GET /health`: Server health check
- `POST /api/v1/scraping-batch`: CSV batch upload and job creation
