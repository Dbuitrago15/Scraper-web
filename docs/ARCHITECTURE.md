# System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the web scraping system designed for processing business information from CSV files and extracting detailed data from Google Maps.

## Core Principles

- **Performance First**: Utilizes shared browser pools and asynchronous processing
- **Scalability**: Built with BullMQ for distributed task processing
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code with ES Modules

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (>=18.0.0)
- **API Framework**: Fastify
- **Task Queue**: BullMQ
- **Message Broker**: Redis
- **Web Scraping**: Playwright
- **Data Validation**: Zod
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
